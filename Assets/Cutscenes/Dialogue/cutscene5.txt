Lila@Glad you made it out, Charles. 
Lila@We've been forced to abandon our affairs on Earth, and the UN has launched an invasion fleet. Your squad is closest to a vital spaceship carrier. We need you to take it down. Corporate engineers have modified your ships to include space-grade thrusters.
Charles@Space-grade!?
Seymour@Those thrusters will take us to the moon!
Lila@This won't be like your other missions. We anticipate heavily armed and organized forces. Best of luck.
Seymour@We don't need luck.
