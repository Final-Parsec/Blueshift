Management@bro, Your first assignment is a small repo in the Horn of Africa.  Somalia has defaulted on their debt, and their land was put up for collateral.  We need to take that land back.  It's just something that happens from time to time; everyone falls on hard times.  
Bro@So I'm a glorified repo man?
Management@These guys barely had the infrastructure to set up their loan, so I don’t expect too many surprises.  However, they have been very uncompliant on our terms and proceedings.  It seems as though they may become violent.  We’ve equipped your scouter with a basic blaster.  It’s up to you how you use it.
Bro@Wait, wha-
Management@We’ll clean up your mess as long as you finish the job.
