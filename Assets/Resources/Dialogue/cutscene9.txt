UN LEADER@This is a time of sorrow, suffering, and inspiration.  Under the new Manhattan Treaty, planet Earth is united.  Under this new treaty, the militaries of the world may act as one.  To take to space and save the world!  However, our first objective as one people, as one planet, is to save our people.  The capitalist moon has seized our assets, bullied our impoverished people into slavery and death.  We turned a blind eye in the name of peace.  The same name that Sol so bravely waves in our faces!  Sol Industries lives and breathes for money.  Now they kill for it too.  I come here to not only plead for a return to the prosperous peace that was kept for so long on our homeland, but also to plead for your surrender.  We are the people of the Earth, and we are very good at war.
