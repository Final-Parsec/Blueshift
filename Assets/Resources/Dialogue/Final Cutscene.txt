Charles@Lila, what the fuck just happened back there?
Lila@Severing ties with corporations like Sol is never easy. We needed to spark a revolution on the way out.
Charles@You've tricked me. Led me betray my people twice. Now I have no home.
Lila@Earth, our homeland, has become a wasteland and we were part of the problem.
Charles@Where are we supposed to go now? Our only refuge was on the moon.
Lila@What do you know about Mars?
Charles@Mars? Isn't that hell hole infested with snakes?
