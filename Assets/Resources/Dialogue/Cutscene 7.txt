Management@100 years ago, the citizens of Earth condemned our peaceful ways.  They condemned our very way of life.  Capitalism, if that's what we must call it, was banished from the very Mother Earth that brought our glorious and beautiful message of money, power, and order to fruition.  Today, a lifetime has passed since then.  After flying, shaken, and beaten from the violence of society to the one place society could not touch, we turn and acknowledge the barbarians that have sent us here!  We breathe life into a century of belittlement, and of sanction!  While they played war and politics, we seeked out knowledge and peace.  With this knowledge, we turn.  With this sentiment, I'm proud to announce... a rebranding.
