Dice Props Pack (Updated 5-20-14)

Stylized Assets

     Thanks for downloading my Dice Props Pack and the first of maybe many more. It comes with many useful generic props you may need in some form or another. I've included the TGA and the PSD files for the textures for ease of manipulation and some textures for example the street signs texture is left rather blank so you can jump right in to add your own text as well as atlas more of the street sign to the texture with the empty space. Assets of similar "grouping" had their textures atlased together therefore use one material for all of the objects in that grouping. This means you could have all these static objects batch and be duplicated many times at the cost of 1 draw call!! This dependant on shaders and image effects however as these things can add extra draw calls but normal shaders and camera gives the group of objects 1 draw call.
Can't say I have a huge amount of free time but I will take requests and support for this pack via email.

     You may use my assets for your games but I do ask that if you do to credit me for my work. Also feel free to drop me a link to it so I can check out any of the great games you guys put out!! One last thing please do not repackage these assets and distribute them or sell them as your own thanks.
